- User can enter DH parameters and the mass of each link to get the lagrangian formulation with any serial manipulator with restrictions on inertia and the center of mass to be exactly in the midpoint between each joint.
- Lagrangian Formulation using MATLAB developing a set of algorithms toread arobot parameter (general form) from .xlsx
file to calculate forward kinematic, jacobian submatrices, manipulator inertia matrix, velocity coupling vector, gravitaâ€‘
tional vector and finally the generalized forces vector in a serial manipulator.
- Improved calculation times ensured accuracy of calculation by cleaning data.
